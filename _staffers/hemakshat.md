My name is Hemakshat. I am a 4+1 MPH student in Epidemiology/Biostatistics. In my undergrad program here at UC Berkeley, I took MCB and Public Health. I aim to apply a health equity framework to analyze facets of medicine.In my spare time, I enjoy playing volleyball and basketball so you will probably see me at RSF. I look forward to meeting you all!
